<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started & development</h1>

<h3>Fork and clone the repository</h3>
The <b class="light-color">vision of this theme</b> is <b class="light-color">simplicity and accessibility</b>, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

<h3>How to start a development docker container</h3>
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.
OneFlow comes with build-in docker configuration using
<a href="https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BretFisher's jekyll serve</a>.
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>
        and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed</li>
    <li>Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run <code>docker compose up</code>.</li>
</ul>
Your site will then be visible at <i>http://0.0.0.0:4000/</i> in any browser.


<hr class="big-sep">

<h1 id="html-and-md">Markdown and HTML</h1>
Use raw and flexible HTML or clear markdown to write your content.
Markdown is rendered with <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kramdown</a>,
which supports applying css classes to the Markdown. That means, you can add notices, boxes and other utilities even to your Markdown content,
as simple as <code>"Text you want to add the classes to {: .class1 .class2}"</code>.
This documentation will show everything in HTML, but as shown in the lines above, applying css classes is also easily possible with Markdown.


<hr class="big-sep">

<h1 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h1>
All of OneFlows features are 100% responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, so your site looks good
on all devices!

<hr class="big-sep">


<h1 id="start-editing">Start editing your Site</h1>
The main parts you want to edit are:
<ul>
    <li><code>README.md</code> for the readme of your repository,</li>
    <li><code>/_data/navigation.yml</code> for the navigation links,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/index.html</code> for your main content,</li>
    <li><code>/_pages/imprint.html</code> for the imprint & privacy note,</li>
    <li><code>_config.yml</code> for the basic setup of your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/images</code> for all images and graphics you use on your site,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/css/custom-styles.css</code> if you want to add custom css styles,</li>
    <li><code>/assets/fonts</code> if you want to add custom fonts and</li>
    <li><code>/_includes/editables</code>
        if you create a website for a client who regularly wants to change parts of the site him/herself.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="skins">Color skins</h2>

OneFlow comes with 10 diverse color skins you can easily apply.
These are: <i>default</i>, <i>air</i>, <i>aqua</i>, <i>contrast</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>dirt</i>, <i>neon</i>, <i>mint</i>, <i>plum</i> and <i>sunrise</i>.
Check the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes?tab=readme-ov-file#skins-color-variations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes documentation about color skins</a> for example images.
Define your preferred skin by changing the value of <code>oneflow-skin</code> in <code>_config.yml.</code>.

<h2 id="masthead">Masthead</h2>
The Masthead, including the navigation bar, offers a few customization options.
All of this configuration can be done in <code>config.yml</code>.<br><br>
First, you can decide whether you like it to be <b class="light-color">sticky</b>, meaning it will stay visible on top of the page even
when you scroll down, or not.
To make the masthead sticky, set <code>sticky-masthead: true</code>.
<br><br>
You can furthermore easily set the <b class="light-color">opacity</b> of the masthead with <code>masthead-opacity: xxx</code>, where xxx is
a number between 0 and 1. A good starting point that works good for most sites is 0.8 to 0.9.
<br><br>
The masthead can either contain a <b class="light-color">logo (or any other image)</b>, or your site title and optionally a sub-title.
If you want to display your logo / image there, set <code>logo: /assets/images/logo.webp</code> or the respective
path to the image and filetype you want to use.
If you don't want your logo / image there, remove the logo path or out-comment it by setting <code>#</code> behind the <code>:</code> like so:
<code> logo: #/assets/...</code>.
By default, the site title, which is also shown in the browser tab, is then displayed instead of the logo.
You can set the title by setting <code>title: "your-website-title"</code>.
Set the subtitle with <code>subtitle: "your-subtitle"</code> or set this to <code>""</code> to have no subtitle.
If you want to display a different title than your default site title in the masthead, you can set this with
<code>masthead_title: "your-masthead-title"</code>. Set this to <code>""</code> to display no title.

<h3 id="nav">Navigation</h3>
To edit the links in the navigation bar, head over to <code>/_data/navigation.yml</code>.
Unter the main-variable, you can set the title and url each nav link should point to.
For linking to a section on the main page, include a "#" before the id, and set the id-attribute within the section-tag or the header-tag of that section.
For external links, you can set blank to true, so the page opens in a new tab, and as URL include the full url with https://
at the beginning.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
As the background for your site, you can either stick with the background colors that come with your chosen color skin,
or you can apply a <b class="light-color">background image</b> instead.
Background image settings are all done in <code>config.yml</code>.
Set <code>background-image: "/path/to/your/background-image.webp"</code>. To have no background-image, remove or out-comment this line.
When working with a background image, it is strongly recommended to use a horizontal background image for the desktop
version of your site and an upright image for the mobile version. You can easily do this, by using a horizontal
image for <code>background-image</code>, and setting a different image (or different version of the same image) for
<code>background-image-mobile</code>. Furthermore, it is also strongly recommended to apply a slightly transparent
overlay to the background image, for better readability of all texts on your site. You can set this
by setting <code>background-image-overlay : rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)</code> or any other rgba color value you like.

<h2 id="popup">Popup</h2>
As some countries, like Germany, require <b class="light-color">information and consent about cookie-usage</b> and the usage of a CDN
for example for deploying sites on GitHub pages, OneFlow comes with a build-in Popup for that purpose.
You can enable or disable the Popup in <code>config.yml</code> with true/false for <code>show-popup</code>.
Do not use quotation marks for setting true/false values in the configuration file.
<br><br>
The existing version of the popup is a suggestion and should (no legal advice given) fulfill german laws regarding cookie and cdn-usage consent.
<br><br>
To edit the content of the popup, navigate to <code>/_includes/popup.html</code> and edit its HTML.
This file also contains a script-tag with the javascript for the popup. This script sets a cookie for one day,
when the user clicks on the "Agree"-button, so the popup is not displayed on every page reload, but only after one day.
Edit the line <code>expiresDate.setDate(expiresDate.getDate() + 1);</code> to set this to a different time interval.

<h2 id="basic-setup">Content & Basic home page setup</h2>
To start adding content to your main page, navigate to <code>/_pages/index.html</code>.
Remove the example content, and start adding your own!
<br><br>
First, you need to set some basics in the YAML front matter.
So, start with:<br>
<code>
    ---<br>
    layout: page<br>
    title: "The Title That Should Display In Your Page Hero"<br>
    excerpt: "The Sub-Title Below Your Main Title"<br>
    permalink: /<br>
    ---
</code><br><br>
You can furthermore customize the <b class="light-color">Page Hero</b>, which is the first thing catching the visitors eyes!
The Page Hero can include:
<ul>
    <li>A title</li>
    <li>A subtitle</li>
    <li>An image</li>
    <li>An image overlay</li>
    <li>A caption</li>
    <li>Action buttons</li>
</ul>
Set and customize them like so:<br>
<code>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;header:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overlay_image: /assets/images/header.webp<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overlay_filter: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caption: "Photo by **[Text](Link)**"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actions:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- label: "Get Started"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url: "https://url-to-link-to.com"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank: true
</code><br><br>
Captions and labels support Markdown.
You can add as many <b class="light-color">action buttons</b> as you like. The have a label, a URL and a "blank"-characteristic.
Blank is either true or false and determines, whether the link opens up in a new tab or not. If this is true, the HTML a-tag
contains <code>target="_blank"</code> as well as <code>rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"</code>, which is important
so that opening link in a new tab doesn't come with security and SEO impairments.
<br><br>
Remember that indentation is important for the YAML front matter.

<h2 id="sections">Sections</h2>
OneFlow offers <b class="light-color">alternating colored sections</b>.<br><br>
If you do not want alternating colors, there is no need to apply any section tags, just write all of your content
outside of any section tags.
To separate different parts of your page, you can drop in a nicely styled big <b class="light-color">separation line</b> easily with <br>
<code>&lt;hr class="section-sep"&gt;</code>. You can use this both with and without alternating colored sections.
<br><br>
To apply alternating colored sections, do the following: <br>
Wrap every section that should be normally colored in <br>
<code>
    &lt;section class="site-section" id="section-2"&gt;<br>
        // Content within the section<br>
    &lt;/section&gt;
</code><br>
For every alternatively colored section, add the class <code>alternative-color</code> to the section. <br>
<h4>Some notes about that:</h4>
Alternatively colored sections don't look too good before the footer. So, it is recommended to always
let the last section of your site be a normally colored one.<br>
Furthermore, if you want the first section of your site to be an alternatively colored one, also add the class
<code>first-section</code> to it. This makes sure the color starts directly below the Page Hero, and there is no small
space in a different color in between Page Hero and first section.

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
Of course, OneFlow comes with build-in styles for normal Markdown/HTML tags like headers, paragraphs, anchor-tags (links) and so on.
There are furthermore some utilities that you can use to organize and style your content in a good-looking and structured way.
Check out the <a href="https://oneflow-jekyll-theme.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">theme website</a> to see example of all of these utilities!
<h3 id="notices">Notices</h3>
Notices highlight a paragraph or a div. Just add the <code>notice</code> class to any element, easy as that.<br>
Apart from the standard-notice, there are some others with different colors, which are:
<ul>
    <li><code>notice--primary</code></li>
    <li><code>notice--success</code></li>
    <li><code>notice--warning</code></li>
    <li><code>notice--danger</code></li>
    <li><code>notice--info</code></li>
</ul>
Apply these classes, instead of the notice-class, to use the different colors.

<h3 id="boxes">Boxes</h3>
Boxes also highlight your content, but with a different styling. Just apply the <code>box</code> class to any div-element
to put it into a box with a nice little rounded border and very subtle background.
Just as notices, boxes offer the same color variations. Keep the box-class with your divs and add one of the following:
<ul>
    <li><code>box--primary</code></li>
    <li><code>box--success</code></li>
    <li><code>box--warning</code></li>
    <li><code>box--danger</code></li>
    <li><code>box--info</code></li>
</ul>
Boxes furthermore can be put into a div with the class <code>box-container</code>.
Within that container, you can apply the <code>box-half</code> class to make a box fill half of the width and therefore
be able to fit 2 boxes next to each other, or the <code>box-third</code> class to make a box fill a third of the width
and therefore be able to fit 3 boxes next to each other. On small screens, boxes stack below each other responsively.

<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
Add the <code>btn</code> class plus any of the following classes to any a-tag to style the link as a button:
<ul>
    <li><code>btn--primary</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--success</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--warning</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--danger</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--info</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--inverse</code></li>
</ul>
You can furthermore edit the size of the button with the following classes:
<ul>
    <li><code>btn--x-large</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--large</code></li>
    <li><code>btn--small</code></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="videos">Responsive video-embed</h3>
Embed a video from YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive, or bilibili that responsively sizes to fit the width of its parent.
This feature is taken un-edit from Minimal Mistakes,
<a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#responsive-video-embed" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
    see the Minimal Mistakes Docu about responsive video embed here
</a>.

<h3 id="galleries">Galleries</h3>
The gallery is as well taken from Minimal Mistakes, slightly edited in style to better fit OnePager Websites.
<a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/helpers/#gallery" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
    Check the Minimal Mistakes Docu about galleries here
</a>.

<h3 id="rounded-images">Rounded images</h3>
Rounded images are a cool helper that displays a circular image in the top of a box,
so that you can add header and a caption below the image. They add a cool visual element and can provide good structure as well.
They can be included easily via YAMl front matter.
Set the front matter like so:   <br>
<code>
    round-images:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - image-path: "/assets/images/image.webp"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size: "full"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; header: "text for the header"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; caption: "text for the caption"<br>
</code><br>
You can include further rounded image boxes by adding a next "- image-path" and all other necessary variables.
Size can be either "full", "half" or "third" and determines, how much of the page width the box with the rounded image
is going to take. With half, two boxes fit next to each other, with third, it's three.<br>
Include the rounded images anywhere with <code>{&percnt; include rounded-images &percnt;}</code>.<br>
You can use any other name than "round-images" for the rounded images. Then, you need to include an id in the include,
like so: <code>{&percnt; include rounded-images id="id-you-chose" &percnt;}</code>. <br>
Half or third boxes stack below each other responsively on smaller screens.

<h3 id="itr">Image-text-rows</h3>
Image-text-rows include an image either on the left or right side, and a header + caption on the other side.
They optionally can include a button with a link. <br>
They can be set via YAMl front matter, and offer huge customization options. Create them like so:<br>
<code>
    image-text-row:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; - header: "text for the header"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excerpt: "text for the caption/excerpt"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; btn-url: "https://your-url.com"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; btn-class: "primary/success/..."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; btn-label: "label for the button"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blank: false<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; image-url: "/assets/images/image.webp"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alt-text: "alternative text for the image"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; image-width "400px"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; image-right: true
</code><br>
Leave out btn-url and the other btn-variables to not include a button. <br>
"Blank" determines whether the link from the button is opened in a new tab or not.   <br>
"Image-right" sets whether the image is on the right side. With true, it is, with false, it is left. <br>
Image and text responsively stack below each other on smaller screens, with the image always on top.

<h2 id="footer">Footer</h2>
You can easily customize the footer in <code>config.yml</code>.
Under <code>footer links</code> you can set the social links that you want to include in the footer.
Just set the <code>url</code> attribute for every social link you want to include, and out-comment the url attribute
for every social link that you do not want to include. <br>
Furthermore, you can set <code>copyright</code> to anything you like, like your or your clients name,
which will display in the footer as '© [year] [name]'", with 'year' and 'name' being replaced by the respective values.<br>
Also, you can include a <code>creator</code> name and url, if you like, which will then display in the
footer as "Created by". If you remove or out-comment the creator attributes, no "Created by" will be shown.

<h2 id="custom-styles">Custom styles</h2>
If you want to add your own custom css, you can do that in the ready-to-use <code>custom-styles.css</code> file
that is located with in <code>/assets/css</code>. Just add your css in there, nothing else you need to do as setup.

<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
Just like Minimal Mistakes, OneFlow uses system fonts for all font stacks, to provide a clean look and
to improve performance.
More information about that in the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/#font-stacks" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">
    Minimal Mistakes Docu about Fonts</a>.<br>
Furthermore, you can easily apply custom fonts within OneFlow.
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>
offer high versatility and are free to use (you just might need to include a license, depending on the font).
They can be hosted locally with ease. I recommend using <a href="https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Google Webfonts Helper</a>
for that. Select the font and font-styles you want there, download the files, and place them in <code>/assets/fonts</code>.
Then open up <code>/_sass/oneflow/_fonts.scss</code> and put the css you got from Google Webfonts Helper there.
That's it, you now host the font locally and can apply it to any text you like.

<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>
OneFlow comes with build-in support for <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Font Awesome Icons</a>.
Font Awesome 6.5.1 is included and hosted locally within OneFlow. Nothing for you to do but apply the icons!
Just add an i-tag with the respective classes, check out the Font Awesome Website to find all their icons.

<h2 id="editables">Editables</h2>
As a Web Developer, especially for private customers or small companies, I've came across the following situation a few times:
The <b class="light-color">client wants to edit parts of the website him/herself regularly</b>, for example to add or delete upcoming events or dates.
Large companies can pay web developers for that, but private customers or small companies often understandably can't afford
long-term maintenance costs. <br>
To make this as easy as possible, utilize the editables-feature from OneFlow!
Put any HTML/Markdown part that the client needs to edit in a separate file and place this file in the
<code>/_includes/editables</code> folder, then include it on the main page with
<code>{&percnt; include /editables/filename.html &percnt;}</code>.<br>
The client then only needs to make changes within the given file, which makes it as as simple and as little error-prone as possible.

<h2 id="customize">Further customization</h2>
OneFlow offers huge customization options without the need to touch any of the layouts, includes or sass files.
If you need even further customization, these directories and files are included in the GitHub Repository,
so you can go ahead and edit all files in every way you want for further customization and fine-granular styling.
The layout structure can be edited within <code>/_layouts/default.html or page.html</code>. The scss stylesheets
are located within the<code>/_sass</code> directory, and includes like the page hero, footer, masthead and also utilities
like the gallery, rounded images or image-text-rows are located within the <code>/_includes</code> folder and can be edited right there.
