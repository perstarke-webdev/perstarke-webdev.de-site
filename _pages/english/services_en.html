<h1>Social Media Announcement of Your Website <small>  <small class="price"> <br /> Fixed Price: €99 </small> </small></h1>

<div class="additional-text" style="display: none;">

    One of the most common questions when it comes to a new website is:<br>
    <b class="light-color">
        How do I announce my new website?
    </b><br>
    If you want to take the social media announcement of your website to the next level, then
    I'll create stories and posts for you, matching the style of your social media presence and your new website.
    Whether you've had the website created by me or not - in both cases, I'm happy to assist you with the announcement!
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 Posts - announcing the new website, and introducing the individual sections in more detail
        </li>
        <li>
            10 Stories, some reusable - for announcing the new website, for more detailed introduction, and for regular further promotion of your website on social media
        </li>
        <li>
            I can also repost the stories and posts from my private and professional accounts to give you even more visibility!
        </li>
    </ul>

        // Check if additionalText is correctly found and has the right class
        if (additionalText && additionalText.classList.contains('additional-text')) {
            if (additionalText.style.display === 'none') {
                additionalText.style.display = 'block';
                button.textContent = 'Hide';
