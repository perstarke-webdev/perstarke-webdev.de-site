<h1>Guarantee Terms</h1>

<ul>
    <li>The money-back guarantee is valid for a period of 90 days after the completion of the website creation, redesign, or the respective invoiced service period:
        <ul>
            <li>For one-time services (e.g., website creation or redesigns), the 90 days start from the invoice date of the final invoice (usually the second invoice).</li>
            <li>For ongoing services (e.g., content updates or support packages), the guarantee applies to the respective invoiced service or service period, and the 90 days start from the respective invoice date.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>The client has the right to decide freely</b> whether to request a refund under the money-back guarantee. To do so, they must provide the reason for their dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li>Claims for the money-back guarantee must be submitted in writing – either through the communication channel used during the collaboration or via the <a href="/en/contact">contact page</a>.</li>
    <li>The client is required to first request a free revision of the website to address any dissatisfaction. Only if the revision does not resolve the issues can a refund claim be submitted.</li>
    <li>The refund will be processed within 30 days of the claim's approval and will be issued using the same payment method as the original payment.</li>
    <li>The money-back guarantee does not apply if the client's dissatisfaction arises from changes or adjustments outside the agreed scope of services or actions by third parties.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to amend or update the money-back guarantee terms at any time, if necessary. Any changes will be published on this page and will take effect immediately.</li>
</ul>
