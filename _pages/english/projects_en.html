<h1>OneFlow Jekyll Theme</h1>
Jekyll is my preferred static website generator and forms the basis for many of my projects.
I developed the OneFlow Jekyll Theme to provide an appealing and easy-to-navigate foundation
for one-pager websites. Whether you're a web developer, business owner, or individual,
this theme offers you a free and simple way to create individually designed one-pagers.
The OneFlow Jekyll Theme is my contribution to the open-source community.
It stands out for its modern aesthetics and clear structure,
making it suitable for both creative presentations and informative business pages.<br><br>

<h1>Homepage Canvas</h1>
In the field of website development, a clear plan can make the difference between a successful
project and one that falls short of expectations.
Clear communication between web developers and clients is essential,
not only for satisfactory results but also for pleasant teamwork.
This is where the Homepage Canvas, developed by me, comes into play - a versatile tool that simplifies communication,
improves collaboration, and assists in collecting and structuring ideas,
preferences, and requirements for website projects.<br><br>
