## Fundamentals

### Readability
Ensure that the text on your website is easy to read, with an appropriate font size and color contrast against the background. Use light colors on a dark background and dark colors on a light background. Readability is key - if your content is hard to read, visitors will leave your website quickly and may not want to visit it again.

### Matching Colors

Use a consistent color scheme throughout your website with colors that complement each other well. For example, <span style="background-color:lightblue;">different</span> <span style="background-color:skyblue;">shades</span> <span style="background-color:deepskyblue;">of</span> <span style="background-color:steelblue;">the</span> <span style="background-color:royalblue;">same</span> <span style="background-color:blue;">color</span> tend to go well together, and <span style="background-color:gold; color: black;">nearly all colors</span> go well with <span style="background-color:gray;">grey</span>/<span style="background-color:black;">black</span>. Some color combinations, like <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black;">yellow</span> and <span style="background-color:purple;">purple</span> or <span style="background-color:pink; color: black;">pink</span> and <span style="background-color:green;">green</span>, do not go well together. Make sure to avoid such clashes to maintain a visually appealing design.

### Responsive Design
Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Test your site on various devices and screen sizes to confirm that readability and clear design remain consistent. You can use free tools like [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) to easily check your website's responsiveness.

### Clear Navigation
Provide a straightforward and intuitive navigation menu so users can easily find the information they need.

### All Important Information
**Clear What You Offer**   
Clearly state what services or products you offer on the homepage or main landing pages. Make sure this information is one of the first things site visitors will see.

**Opening Times, Address, Contact**   
Check that all relevant basic information, such as your business hours, physical address, and contact information, are prominently visible.

**Relevant Further Info**   
Ensure you have added any other further information that users might need to know about your business.

### Working Links
Regularly check all links on your website to ensure they are working correctly, both manually and with a link checker tool like [DrLinkChecker](https://www.drlinkcheck.com/).

### Basic SEO
Check if your site implements basic search engine optimization practices to improve your website's visibility on search engines. This includes:
- Usage of relevant keywords for your business
- Meaningful usage of headings, sub-headings, and so on
- No technical issues on your website
- Meaningful image names and alternative texts for images
- Relevant and qualitative content

### Loading Times
Optimize your website's loading speed to ensure a quick and efficient user experience. One key point here is to reduce image sizes. You can, for example, make sure to convert images to a format like webp, which significantly reduces image size while maintaining high image quality.

## Slightly More Advanced

### Colors Matching Your Branding
Ensure that the colors used on your website align with your brand's identity and aesthetics. If you have a logo or a certain in-store color design, let your website match this branding.

### Psychology of Colors
Utilize color psychology to influence user behavior and convey the right emotions through your website's design. For example:
- <span style="background-color:red; color: white;">Red</span>, <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black;">yellow</span>, <span style="background-color:orange; color: black;">orange</span>, and <span style="background-color:deeppink; color: white;">strong pink</span> can convey feelings of urgency
- <span style="background-color:green; color: white;">Green</span>, <span style="background-color:blue; color: white;">blue</span>, <span style="background-color:white; color: black;">white</span>, and <span style="background-color:lightpink; color: black;">subtle pink</span> can provide a feeling of calmness
- <span style="background-color:blue; color: white;">Blue</span>, <span style="background-color:grey; color: white;">dark-grey</span>, and <span style="background-color:darkgrey; color: white;">light-grey</span> can provide a feeling of objectivity
- <span style="background-color:goldenrod; color: black;">Gold</span>, <span style="background-color:#616F39; color: white;">gold-green-ish</span>, and <span style="background-color:grey; color: white;">dark-grey</span> can provide a feeling of expensiveness and luxury
- <span style="background-color:blue; color: white;">Blue</span>, <span style="background-color:green; color: white;">green</span>, and <span style="background-color:darkgrey; color: white;">light-grey</span> can provide a feeling of trust


### Stand Out from Competition
Design your website in a way that differentiates it from competitors and highlights your unique selling points. If all your competitors use a bright and colorful website, you might consider standing out not only by highlighting what makes you unique but also by using a more subtle and professional color scheme. Conversely, if all your competitors use a professional-feeling and subtle color scheme with lots of black and grey, consider standing out with well-chosen eye-catching colors.

### Feeling Matching Your Target Customers
Create a website atmosphere that resonates with your target audience's preferences and expectations. If you have a business that sells comedy shows for kids, you will want your website to seem funny and easygoing, but still trustworthy and professional.

### Social Proof
Include testimonials, reviews, and case studies to build credibility and trust with your visitors. Social proof is one of the strongest influence factors in human psychology, so if you have the chance to use this, make sure not to miss out on it. However, ensure not to use fake social proof!

### 404 Page
Create a custom 404 error page ("page not found") that helps users navigate back to the main parts of your website if they encounter a broken link.

### Image Quality
Use high-quality images that are relevant to your content and optimized for fast loading. Low-quality, pixelated images leave bad impressions on your website visitors. Also, the saying *"a picture says more than a thousand words"* is definitely true - so use meaningful, inviting pictures and photos that captivate your website visitors and leave an amazing first impression.

### Clear Call to Action
Provide clear and compelling calls to action (CTAs) that guide users towards desired actions, such as making a purchase, contacting you, or visiting your local store.
