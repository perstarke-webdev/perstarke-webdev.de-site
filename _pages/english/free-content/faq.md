## How does the collaboration for creating a website work?
Since this is a very common question, I have published a short blog post on my website about it. You can [find it here](https://perstarke-webdev.de/posts/en/your-website).

## How much does a remake or a new creation of my site cost?
The cost of creating or redesigning a website varies depending on the scope and complexity of the project.
Some factors that can affect the cost include the size of the website, the number of required pages and features, as well as the desired maximum time expenditure.
Prices can vary significantly between providers.
It also depends on whether you have the website created by an external provider (agency or freelancer) or if you try to create it yourself.
Creating a website yourself is possible, with coding knowledge, entirely for free, but it requires time and a lot of knowledge. There are also website builders that allow this without coding skills. These are often free in the basic version, but in the pro version, you usually have monthly costs ranging from €15 to €50 depending on the provider. Since there are many important points that are crucial for creating an appealing and effective website, an external provider is often the better choice, as the end result is usually noticeably better and more effective. However, this depends on your budget and how much time you are willing to invest yourself. Even self-created websites can be good and helpful.
As a rough guide:
Large web agencies usually charge between €1,000 and €20,000 for a website.
For freelancers, you can often get a not too complex site for just under €1,000.
My vision is to offer the possibility of an appealing, practical, and effective website even to small businesses, startups, or private individuals who cannot afford these prices. Therefore, I offer basic homepages starting at €499, which already include basic customizability, search engine optimization, adaptation to various display sizes, and of course a structured and meaningful design as well as visually appealing and psychologically optimized layout.
For this standard price, you can book individual additional options with fixed prices from me, or get a completely individual site at an equally individual but affordable price.

## Can I keep my old domain (for a remake)?
In many cases, it is possible to keep your old domain when redesigning your website. Most web developers have experience with domain transfers and can assist you with this.
However, it is important to clarify in advance if there are any technical or contractual restrictions that could prevent the transfer. This depends on how your current website was created and where the domain is registered.
You either registered the domain yourself or your previous development team took care of it.
If you did not register the domain yourself, you should definitely ask the previous development team where it is registered and how you can gain access to it. You should also ask how the website was created, i.e., with which tool(s) and which hosting provider (hosting providers are the ones whose platform the website is hosted on).
If you want to do the transfer yourself, you will often find tutorials on the respective provider's website.
Alternatively, just share the information with your new development team, who will usually be able to assist you with it without any problems.

In short: In most cases, transferring the domain is not a problem.

## Will the findability on Google remain (for a remake)?
Yes, in most cases, the findability on Google will remain when you redesign your website.
However, there can be temporary losses in search engine ranking while Google indexes the changes and integrates the new pages. This is normal and should recover over time (a few days, with a reasonably structured site with basic search engine optimization, SEO).
With a reasonably created website, SEO practices are integrated, so your ranking on Google should ideally even improve.

## Will my website be found on Google (for a new creation)?
Yes, a well-designed and optimized website should be found on Google and other search engines.
How high your site appears in Google searches cannot be predicted or guaranteed, as the ranking in search results depends on many factors, including the quality of the content, the technical implementation of the site, the site structure, backlinks (how many other websites link to yours), and much more.
It is important that your website is optimized for search engines and that you create high-quality content to increase the chances of a good ranking.
Google will definitely index the website within a few days, meaning it will be added to its database and shown in searches.
The only question is how high up in the searches your website will be found. Various SEO practices help with this. Depending on how important this is to you, development teams can only include basic SEO or more complex tactics for even better findability. These are then of course reflected in the price of the website.
Examples of improving your Google ranking are:

- **Relevant Keywords**: Use keywords that your target audience uses when searching for your offer in the meta data and content of your website.
- **High-Quality Content**: Create informative, entertaining, and unique content that interests your website visitors and provides them with added value.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure that your website is optimized for mobile devices, as Google uses a "Mobile First" indexing and prefers mobile-friendly pages.
- **Technical Optimization**: Ensure fast loading times for your website and fix technical issues such as broken links or missing meta data.
- **Links**: Obtain high-quality backlinks from other websites to increase your site's authority.
- **Local SEO**: If your business operates locally, optimize your website for local searches by using local keywords and creating a Google My Business entry so you can be found on Google Maps. Even if you do not operate locally, you can make your business and thus your website findable on Google Maps, which is often a good idea. I myself, for example, am also listed on Google Maps, with my home address, although I work completely remotely and am not locally bound.
- **Social Media**: Use social media to share your content and build a stronger online presence. This can also help generate backlinks.

These are just some basic examples; SEO is a complex topic and there are many other points that can influence your Google ranking.

## How do I announce the website?
There are many ways to promote and announce your website.
One way is to use social media to share your website and its content. It doesn't have to be complicated; posting an Instagram story with a screenshot of your site and a link to it regularly can be very helpful. When the website goes live, make a small post about it, and you're done. If you want to do more, there are many templates available on the free online design tool "Canva." Alternatively, your development team will surely be happy to help you create stories and posts if this is an important point for you.
You can also send newsletters to your customers and interested parties to inform them about news and updates on your website if you have an email list.
Additionally, you can list your website in industry directories and relevant online platforms to gain more visibility. Google My Business, for example, but also more industry-specific sites.
And of course, the SEO already mentioned above.

I also offer a service for creating social media announcements for your website for only €99, including:
- 2 posts announcing the new website and introducing individual sections in more detail
- 10 stories, some reusable, for announcing the new website, more detailed introductions, and regular further promotion of your website on social media
- I can also repost the stories and posts from my private and professional accounts to give you even more visibility!
