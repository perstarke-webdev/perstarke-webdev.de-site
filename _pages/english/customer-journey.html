<h2>1. Free Initial Consultation</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We start with a free consultation via your preferred means of communication (WhatsApp, Telegram, email, video calls, or in person over coffee. Coffee is on me!).</li>
    <li>You'll share your wishes and ideas. You can also use the <a href="/canvas">"Homepage Canvas"</a> I created, a tool to help you brainstorm and communicate your needs clearly and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Understanding Your Needs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will let you know if I need any additional information or photos from you to proceed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Creating the First Draft</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will create the first draft of your site based on our discussion and your provided information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Reviewing and Feedback</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will show you the draft, and you can provide feedback and suggest any changes you want.</li>
    <li>We will revise the site until you are completely happy with it.</li>
    <li>I guarantee your satisfaction - or I work for free! If you want to learn more, <a href="/en/guarantee-terms">read the money-back guarantee terms</a> or just ask me.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Launching Your Website</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No further work for you! With the <a href="/en/services/comfort-web-success-package">Comfort Web Success Package</a> or if you've booked the Hosting & Setup, I will take care of everything else. I'll put your website online under your desired domain, ensuring it stays functional and uninterrupted.</li>
    <li>If not, I will provide guidance on how to do this yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Annual Check-Up and Update</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This service is included in the Comfort Web Success Package or can be booked as an additional service.</li>
    <li>Once a year, at a time that suits you, we will reconvene. You can tell me any updates or changes you want, and I'll provide feedback on new web trends, design possibilities, and optimization opportunities.</li>
    <li>Together, we will decide on any updates or changes to keep your website current and effective.</li>
    <li>If you haven't booked this service, you can still get back to me with any questions or concerns!</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Ongoing Support</h2>
<ul>
    <li>For small changes, you can always reach out to me for free, and I'll get it done for you!</li>
    <li>For larger updates, I offer affordable website updates ranging from €99 to €299, depending on your needs.</li>
    <li>With the Annual Check-Up or the Comfort Web Success Package, one update per year is included.</li>
    <li>So no worries, I got you covered!</li>
</ul>
