The Homepage Canvas I developed has now been published in the renowned magazine 'Informatik-Aktuell'! (In German).

There I explain the concept of the canvas in detail and give tips on how to use it - both from the
the development team as well as from the customer's side in web development.

For detailed insights into the idea of the canvas and how to work successfully with the canvas, [read the article here](https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/entwicklung/methoden/strategische-website-planung-mit-dem-homepage-canvas.html).

I was very happy about the opportunity to publish an article in Informatik-Aktuell, it is my first
article in a specialist magazine :)
