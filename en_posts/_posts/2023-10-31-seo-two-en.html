SEO is an incredibly important topic in web development!<br>
Being well-positioned on Google (or other search engines) is undeniably a crucial goal for a website. Improving your website's position from 8 to 4 in a Google search can lead to an average of four times more visitors, and if you reach position 1, it's an additional twelvefold increase! <a href="#1">[1]</a>, <a href="#2">[2]</a><br>
<br>
In this series of posts, I want to show you what you can do to optimize your site for search engines.<br>
<br>
Each post will explain a "to-do" for your website's SEO.<br>
<br>
The prerequisite is always that the absolute basics of your website are in place! This means you have relevant content, well-written texts, appropriate keywords for your target audience in your texts, and a clear and appealing website design. This also includes a proper navigation system to make all content easily accessible. If these basics are not in place, further tricks won't do much for your SEO.<br>
<br>

Let's start with To-Do #2 for your SEO - <strong>A good URL structure!</strong><br>

<hr>

<h3> URL structure and SEO </h3>

A good URL structure is essential for SEO because it helps search engines better understand a website's content and structure, influences user behavior, and facilitates a structured website layout.<br>
<br>
The following points are important:

<hr>

<h3> Readability </h3>

Use <span class="green">clear words</span>, avoid <span class="red">cryptic characters</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="green bold">Readable URL:</span><br>
<div class="green-box url-box">
    https://yourwebsite.com/example-url
</div>
<br>
<span class="red bold">Unreadable URL:</span><br>
<div class="red-box url-box">
    https://websitexyz2.com/example17xp
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Relevance </h3>

The URL should clearly reflect the page's content.<br>
<br>
<span class="lighter">For example, if you have a website about recipes:</span><br>
<br>
<span class="green bold">Relevant URL:</span><br>
<div class="green-box url-box">
    https://your-recipes.com
</div>
<br>
<span class="red bold">Irrelevant URL:</span><br>
<div class="red-box url-box">
    https://your-cool-website.com
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Conciseness </h3>

Keep URLs as short as possible without sacrificing relevant information.<br>
<br>
<span class="lighter">For example, if you have a website about recipes:</span><br>
<br>
<span class="green bold">Concise URL:</span><br>
<div class="green-box url-box">
    https://your-recipes.com
</div>
<br>
<span class="red bold">Too long URL:</span><br>
<div class="red-box url-box">
    https://recipes-cooking-baking-delicious-yums-healthy-fitness-protein.com
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Structure </h3>

URLs should reflect your site's structure.<br>
<br>
For example, if you have a "Blog" subpage on your website and it lists all the posts you've written for the blog, the URL for the Blog subpage could be:
<div class="url-box">
    https://yourwebsite.com<span class="green">/blog</span>
</div>
and the individual posts would have URLs like:
<div class="url-box">
    https://yourwebsite.com<span class="green">/blog/post-topic</span>
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Hyphens Instead of Underscores </h3>

Search engines prefer <span class="green">hyphens</span> over <span class="red">underscores</span> to separate words.<br>
<br>
<span class="green bold">Hyphens:</span>
<div class="url-box green-box">
    https://your-website.com
</div><br>
<span class="red bold">Underscores:</span>
<div class="url-box red-box">
    https://your_website.com
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Lowercase </h3>

URLs are case-sensitive - <span class="green">/blog</span> is generally NOT the same as <span class="red">/Blog</span>.<br>
<br>
For better clarity and consistency, you should use lowercase, as search engines prefer it.<br>
<br>
<span class="green bold">Consistent Lowercase:</span>
<div class="url-box green-box">
    https://your-website.com
</div><br>
<span class="red bold">Inconsistent Lowercase:</span>
<div class="url-box red-box">
    https://Your-Website.com
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Static URLs </h3>

URLs can contain <span class="red">dynamic parameters like "?id=123"</span>.<br>
<br>
<span class="lighter">In some contexts, this makes sense and is necessary, for example, if you have a website with hundreds of recipes, and the ID of a recipe is included as a parameter in the URL to avoid creating hundreds of separate subpages.</span><br>
<br>
However, if you can <span class="green">avoid dynamic parameters</span>, you should, as it makes your website more discoverable and accessible to search engines.

<hr>

<h3> Canonical Tags </h3>

If you have different versions of the same page or if a page can be reached through multiple URLs, it can confuse search engines.<br>
<br>
For example, if you have a subpage on your website that lists all your blog posts and it's accessible through both the URL <div class="url-box">https://your-website.com<span class="bold">/blog</span></div> and <div class="url-box">https://your-website.com<span class="bold">/posts</span></div> you should use a canonical tag to indicate which URL is considered the "preferred" one for search results.<br>
<br>
For each version of the same page, you should include the following on your page, where the <span class="italic">href=</span><span class="darker-green">""</span> points to the preferred "canonical" version of the page:

<div class="url-box">
    <span class="yellow">&lt;link</span> rel=<span class="darker-green">&quot;canonical&quot;</span> href=<span class="darker-green">&quot;https://your-website.com/blog&quot;</span><span class="yellow">&gt;</span>
</div>

<hr>

<h3> Permanence </h3>

<span class="red">Don't change URLs constantly</span>; <span class="green">try to keep URLs as stable as possible</span>.<br>
<br>
If you do need to change a URL, implement a <span class="green">redirect from the old to the new URL</span> so that the page can still be found through the old URL. This is helpful for user-friendliness and for search engines.
